Postmortem
In the wake of the release of ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19, at around 7:00 West African Time (GMT) here in Ghana, an outage struck an isolated Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache web server. GET requests on the server yielded 500 Internal Server Errors, when the expected response should have been an HTML file defining a simple Holberton WordPress site.

Debugging Odyssey
Our intrepid bug hunter, steve (steve192... yes, like my actual initials on GitHub ;)...), stumbled upon the issue around 19:20 PST, prompted to confront it. He promptly embarked on a quest to vanquish this enigmatic issue.

Checked running processes using ps aux. Two apache2 processes - root and www-data - were found to be in action.

Explored the sites-available folder in the /etc/apache2/ directory and ascertained that the web server was serving content from /var/www/html/.

In one terminal, conducted an strace on the PID of the root Apache process. In another, summoned a curl to the server. Great expectations... only to face disappointment. strace divulged no useful information.

Repeated step 3, this time with the PID of the www-data process. Kept expectations more modest this time... but lo and behold! strace unveiled an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error when attempting to access the file /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.

Scoured through files in the /var/www/html/ directory one by one, utilizing Vim's pattern-matching skills to pinpoint the erroneous .phpp file extension. Located it in the wp-settings.php file (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );).

Swiftly removed the surplus p from the line.

Launched another curl expedition on the server. 200 - All good!

Crafted a Puppet manifesto to automate the eradication of this typo.

In a Nutshell
In short, it was a typo, a classic tale. The WordPress application encountered a critical error in wp-settings.php when trying to load the file class-wp-locale.phpp. The correct file name, situated in the wp-content directory of the application folder, was class-wp-locale.php.

The solution was a straightforward correction of the typo, simply removing the extra p.

Safeguarding the Future
This incident was not a web server error but an application error. To shield against such escapades in the future, do consider the following:

Testing! Test, test, and test some more. Test the application before it sets sail. This error could have been detected and addressed much earlier if the application had been rigorously tested.

Keep a vigilant eye. Enable an uptime monitoring service like UptimeRobot to provide instant alerts in the event of a website outage.

It's worth noting that in response to this error, a Puppet manifesto titled 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp was conjured to automate the resolution of any identical errors should they dare to resurface in the future. The manifesto promptly replaces any phpp extensions in the file /var/www/html/wp-settings.php with php.

But of course, it's all smooth sailing from here, for we are programmers, and we learn from our misadventures to forge ahead.
